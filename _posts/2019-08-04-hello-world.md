`Hello, World!` or **Welcome**, as we normally like to say,  to my blog. Let's get started with "What?", "Why?" and "How?", questions, few of you might be having.
<div class="bg-light border p-2" markdown="1">
```
What {random blog,  stuff to share}

Why {learn stuff, share stuff}

How {weekly posts}
```
</div>

Well,  that's very short ;).  Firstly, this is a random blog, random because, it it random, so I would be sharing completely random stuff here, ranging from `Cats` to `Codes`, through `Coffee`. And, those 3 Cs are definitely `Coincidence`. This is it for the post then. Do check my website and review.
